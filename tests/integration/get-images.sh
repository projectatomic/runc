# The script is self-contained/standalone and is used from a few places
# that need to ensure the images are downloaded. Its output is suitable
# for consumption by shell via eval (see helpers.bash).
#
# XXX: Latest available images are fetched. Theoretically,
# this can bring some instability in case of a broken image.
# In this case, images will need to be pinned to a checksum
# on a per-image and per-architecture basis.
