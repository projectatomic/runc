This branch is to be used solely for runc/libcontainer vendored
by https://github.com/containers/podman/tree/v4.0-rhel

Currently it contains runc v1.1.2, plus the backport of CVE-2024-21626 fixes.

The reason why the above branch of podman can't bump runc/libcontainer
vendoring to v1.1.12 is it requires Go 1.17+ (because of
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/55462355d69)
while podman is being built with Go 1.16.
